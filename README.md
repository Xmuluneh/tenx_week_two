# Data warehouse with MySQL, DBT, Airflow

In collaboration with a municipal traffic department, I am actively involved in the collection of traffic data through the deployment of swarm UAVs (drones) across diverse locations within the city. The primary objective is to leverage the gathered data for enhancing overall traffic management and supporting various undisclosed projects. Assigned with this crucial task, my company is undertaking the development of a scalable data warehouse. This warehouse will serve as the repository for vehicle trajectory data, meticulously derived from the analysis of footage captured by swarm drones and stationary roadside cameras.

#### The objective of this project is to execute the essential tasks outlined below:

- A data warehouse (PostgresQL)
- An orchestration service (Airflow)
- An ELT tool (dbt)
